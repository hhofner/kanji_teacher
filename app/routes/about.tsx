      <p>
        Oh My Kanji is a self-study Kanji app. The main focus of this
        application is to help you learn Kanji by writing more. In Japan, school
        children learn Kanji by writing them over and over again. While some may
        find this method tedious, it can be effective for some.
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh My Kanji also has an opiniated approach. The user is meant to choose
        what Kanjis they will take time to learn. This is done by selecting a
        set of Kanjis for the week. The user can then study these Kanjis until
        the end of the week where they then test themselves and then move on to
        another set.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, Oh My Kanji will provide a set of other features that
        complete the Kanji learning experience. Below you can see a list of
        planned features. While not all of these features are implemented yet,
        they are planned for the future.
